# mybfi - a brainf\*ck interpreter

## Compilation
1. Make sure that both make and gcc are installed
2. Run "make" command inside a terminal

## Usage
./mybfi *filename*  |  ./mybfi test_examples/hello_world.bf

### PS
It actually can read from any file, not only ".bf" or ".b", i am too tired to implement that sry :(
