# mybfi - a brainf\*ck interpreter

## Compilation (*NIX systems)
1. Make sure that both make and gcc are installed
2. Run "make" command inside a terminal

## Usage
./mybfi *filename*  |  ./mybfi test_examples/hello_world.bf

### PS
It actually can read from any file, not only ".bf" or ".b", i am too tired to implement that sry :( Also it is a remake of my own BF interpreter that was originaly written in JS, check out https://github.com/Xpaul6/JS-BF-interpreter
